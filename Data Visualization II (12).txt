# Step 1: Import necessary libraries
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Load the Titanic dataset
titanic_data = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Step 3: Create a box plot of 'age' with respect to 'sex' and 'survived'
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

Observations and Inferences from the Box Plot:


1. Gender-Based Age Distribution:


The box plot reveals that there may be differences in the age distribution between males and females.


Females: The median age for females might be lower than for males, and there may be fewer outliers in terms of extreme ages.


Males: The age distribution for males could be wider, with a higher range of ages, as there may have been more adult males on the ship compared to females.

2. 
Survival Status and Age Distribution:


When the survival status (whether the individual survived or not) is factored in, we can observe potential patterns in the age distribution:


Survivors (hue = 1): The age distribution for survivors may show a tendency for certain age groups to have a higher survival rate. For example, you might see that children and young adults (both male and female) have a higher likelihood of surviving, as this was a well-documented aspect of the Titanic disaster (women and children were given priority in lifeboats).


Non-Survivors (hue = 0): Non-survivors could show a different age distribution, with more adults and possibly a higher median age, indicating that older individuals had a lower chance of survival.


3. Outliers:


The presence of outliers may indicate individuals who were much younger or older than most passengers. For instance, there might be a few older individuals (perhaps elderly passengers) or very young children who stand out in the data.


4. Overall Inference:


From the box plot, we can infer that age played a significant role in survival rates. Younger passengers (especially children) and females had a higher chance of surviving the Titanic disaster, which is reflected in the distinct median values and spread for survivors compared to non-survivors.
